# IOT based Smart Sensor Agriculture System and Crop Recommendation using Machine Learning

Internet of things has the ability to transform the world and 
has the capability to atomize any work in an efficient way. 
Thus, the use of IOT in the field of smart farming has the 
ability to increase productivity and it is performed with the 
help of automation. There has been various works carried out 
in the field of smart farming [1] the crops are monitored by the 
devices such as Arduino, breadboard, Wi-Fi module, soil 
moisture sensor and temperature sensor.Live data feed is 
obtained from thingsspeak.com. It help the farmers to receive 
data regarding the soil moisture and temperature, thus helps in 
continuous monitoring of the agricultural fields. In this we are 
going to improve the system by using GSM module. The soil 
moisture sensor, pressure sensor, water level detector are 
connected to GSM module through which messages are sent to 
the farmers. Huge dataset can be handled efficiently using Big 
Data [2] Big Data technology with Hadoop for distributed 
computing transfers the relational database table through the 
tool kit called as Sqoop and is stored in Hbase. To access the 
values of Hbase, hive query processing is done which is used 
for the further analysis. This system stores the data in cloud 
through NodeMCU. The whole data is send to hive using 
Python. With the help of cloud computing the data is accessed 
virtually. [3] The goal is to predict crop yield based on the 
various needs necessary for the development of the crop. The 
yield analysis and crop prediction is performed using the data.
Extraction technique based on the association rule for a 
particular region. ie District of TamilNadu, India. There are 
several studies that are conducted in the field of Big Data, [4] 
the study of demographics in Big Data Technology is related 
to the statistical measure that is the study of the human 
population in a given period of time. It focuses mainly on 
birth, death rate, literacy rate and marriages. In the computer 
age, the field of social sciences is merging with the field of 
computing to exploit the ability to collect and analyze data on 
a large scale. This study deals with Big Data technology with 
Hadoop, which Map uses to reduce the work of frames for 
distributed processing. In this case, the table values in the 
relational database are transferred via the toolkit called Sqoop 
and stored in Hbase. To access Hbase values, Hive query 
processing is used, which is used for the next analysis. Since 
then, the hive has some high latency restrictions, however, the 
Hbase lacks analytical capabilities. This technology will 
produce the best possible solution for analyzing data. [5] 
Prediction of yield according to the various requirements 
necessary for the development of crops. This paper presents a 
brief analysis of crop yield and prediction using a data mining 
technique based on the association rule for the selected region. 
That is, the Tamil Nadu district in India. The experimental 
result shows that the proposed work efficiently provides crop 
yield. For this study, all the required data for the crop 
prediction are collected which are used in testing and training 
phases. The training phases consists of preprocessing, 
clustering Data, Applying Associate rule mining and 
generating rules. In the testing phase the user gives the 
requirement based on which the predictions are carried 
out.This work suggests crop only for Tamil Nadu district 
which has been improved by our system by providing diverse 
suggestions for all the states of India. The experimental result 
shows the accuracy of crop prediction and recommendation. 
Thereby, helping the farmers to increase the yield. The 
recommendation system compares two machine learning 
algorithms, KNN and SVM to find the most accurate 
algorithm which recommends crops based on soil type. The 
system also generates daily reports to farmers regarding Air 
pressure, Soil moisture, Temperature and Humidity.
